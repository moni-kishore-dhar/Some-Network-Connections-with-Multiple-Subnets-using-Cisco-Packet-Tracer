Abstract:
The purpose of this project is to design a suitable network system for International Apex University in such a way that represents how much efficient the interconnectivity of the system and sub networks of the whole university is. Both wired and wireless connectivity establish in this university’s network infrastructure. This university networks infrastructure consists two lab, single subnet for each server room, reception, classroom, library, admission office, administrative office, employee room, faculty room which are connected with 5 routers using wire and this network also provides wireless internet access for everyone. This complex network supports business process like admissions, results, advising etc.

Introduction:
The computer network represents a component, especially on how it enhances the functional performance in different fields and organizations, such as companies and Universities. A University’s computer network performs so many functions, such as connecting students with the university, faculty, the library, and over the internet. Most universities today use the network to provide online education by connecting widely dispersed students with their professors directly. For this reason, computer networks play a vital role in the education area by providing efficient communications for the university environment. However, the design of computer networks differs from one university to another. This is as a result of many factors which determine the differences.

In this project, the task is to create a complete model of the complex network by discovering the interconnectivity of the systems and sub networks, which will reflect the International Apex University’s structure and facilities.

Objectives:
The main goal of this project is to present a Local Area Network model design suitable for a University by discovering the interconnectivity of the systems and sub-networks. Many universities are searching for ways to integrate networks that have security, backup, and other features available in a university network. The universities are faced with challenges in designing a network that is equal in the standards used by developed countries. The main problem they face deals with a profound budget deficit. This project will help these universities to design a network that employs low-cost solutions without unacceptable compromises in security or quality.

Components:
• Router
• Server (DHCP+DNS+WEB)
• Switch
• Wireless Router
• Access Point
• PC
• Laptop
• Wireless Smart Device
• Printer
• Cloud and TV

Connection Setup:
The network is divided into subnets and all the subnets are connected through router and all routers are interconnected to each other. Each classroom, lab, library, employees room, faculty room, admission office, administrative office has own subnets. All the IP of end devices are provided through one DHCP server across the whole network.
